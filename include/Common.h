                 Conditional Inclusion of Custom IOCTLs
***********************************************************************************/

/**
 * @brief This section allows for the inclusion of user-defined IOCTLs.
 *
 * User-defined IOCTLs can be defined starting from NDISRD_USER_IOCTL_INDEX in the user_ioctls.h file.
 * This provides flexibility for extending the functionality of the Windows Packet Filter Driver
 * with custom operations as needed.
 *
 * Example:
 * #ifndef USER_IOCTLS_H
 * #define USER_IOCTLS_H
 *
 * #define IOCTL_NDISRD_CUSTOM_OPERATION_1\
 *     CTL_CODE(FILE_DEVICE_NDISRD, NDISRD_USER_IOCTL_INDEX, METHOD_BUFFERED, FILE_ANY_ACCESS)
 *
 * #define IOCTL_NDISRD_CUSTOM_OPERATION_2\
 *     CTL_CODE(FILE_DEVICE_NDISRD, NDISRD_USER_IOCTL_INDEX + 1, METHOD_BUFFERED, FILE_ANY_ACCESS)
 *
 * // Add more custom IOCTLs here...
 *
 * #endif // USER_IOCTLS_H
